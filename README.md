## Personal README

The objective of my readme page is to introduce myself and share some information that maybe helpful for us to break the ice, communicate, collaborate and adjust expectations effectively.

In it, I share my professional and personal values, what drives me, what makes me grumpy, and what my workflow looks like.

It will probably be useful mostly for my colleagues and collaborators (current and future) to read.

### Quick Bio

Hey folks, I’m Ve Sharma! I’m currently a Solution Engineer focusing on AI powered Dev Tools (Github Copilot) & Agentic DevOps at Microsoft based out of Vancouver, BC.

Effectively, I’ll be helping with AI dev tool adoption - this is something I’ve done with devs at my last engineering org and the devRel work I do outside of my main wheelhouse. I come from a series of startup stints of various sizes as both founder and a technical exec. Having done pseudo DevRel with Google as a previous builder, I really enjoy this specific type of role focused on dev Tools.

Feel free to read more at my [portfolio site here](https://vesharma.dev).


Outside of work I love to spend my time doing physical activities especially outdoors. You can catch me climbing a rock face in Squamish BC, or doing a HIIT workout class. I suppose this makes me a typical Vancouverite!

On being a typical Vancouverite, we love the rain (well, most folks don’t), but as part of my personal and professional ethos, `I’m a big believer in learning to dance in the rain` - metaphorically speaking. **I’m an optimist at heart ** and it’s probably how I’ve gotten through the 0-1 phase startup pain 🙂. I always try to find the opportunity in any challenge and the best in people.

### Random facts

- I am 🇨🇦 🇨🇳 🇵🇭 🇮🇳
- I'm a dancing in the rain kind of person (metaphorically speaking)
- I love to rock climb outdoors (my 2 favorite spots are in Squamish BC and The Feathers in Washington state) 💙
- Favorite video game 🎮 franchieses of all time are Halo, Mass Effect, and Battlefield
- My Myers Briggs personality type is `ENFP` (The campaigner) which is "a personality type with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Prospecting traits. These people tend to embrace big ideas and actions.
  " according to 16personalities.com

### What are my favorite things to work on

- Coding
- DevRel - I love connecting and learning with other developers
- Making progress/growing in general. This can be professionaly or personally. As long I'm making progress of any kind that's when I'm most content.

### What I value from others

- `Psychological safety.` This is the bed rock for any high performing and creates an inclusive, safe space for all. The best work I've seen comes from this bedrock.
- `Growth mindset.` Nobody's ever perfect. The important thing to accept it and don't overlook opportunities to improve.
- `Integrity.` Trust is everything. If the underlying assumption is X person has integrity, it makes everything else easier for both parties.
- `Asynchronous work & traceability.` I have generally been on remote teams, so I really appreciate it when my team-mates keep a written trace of notes and decisions that may have been taken in my absence.
- `Fun Dev memes.` It makes the day to day work more fun for the team!

### What I think are my strengths

- `Resourcefulness.` I can stretch a budget really far or do a project with minimal resources. Partly why I think I became a founder.
- `Accountability.` If I say that I'm going to do something, I will deliver. I hate to lie, to disappoint, and I'm not afraid to be transparent
- `Resilience.` Definitely my superpower. I can take a lot of hits and keeping getting back up.

### Things I'm working to improve

- `Leadership.` I am always learning to improve this muscle and how to best delegate to others. I've learned how to lean into my servant leadership style to most benefit my team.
- `Conflict management.` I can feel uncomfortable when conflicts happen. What I've learned is that the only thing you can control in life is yourself and not others. How you respond (not react) is everything.
- `Boundary setting.` I'm working to be more efficient and intentional with my time. I can take on too much and come at the expense of me or the team (as a manager). This is an improving area however and have learned how to lean more on my tech leads or seniors more.

### What makes me uncomfortable

- Overt aggressiveness that's unncessary.
- Being in a siutation that deviates from my values of integrity
- Environments that are noisy and/or crowded.

### What makes me grumpy

- When someone undermines psychological safety for the team.
- Witnessing injustice and incivilities. When people are not acting in a fair way.
- When people are not being respectful towards me or anyone else.
- Doing work without understanding the why.
  
### How to know when I'm (really) grumpy

I'm pretty good at masking it to be honest. But I'm generally a calm, collected person so please feel you have the psychological safety to ask if there's doubt about my grumpiness. 

### What have my past managers done that I like

- _Defend the interests of the team._
-_ Congratulate successes and efforts,_ and provide honest feedback to help team-mates improve.
- Take the time to share useful tips and provide **coaching** when appropriate.
- _Not be afraid to roll up their sleeves_ and help out when times are tough.

### What I do outside of work

- Rockclimbing
- Physical activities like working out, HIIT classes.
- Playing Video games (Battlefield, Halo, Star wars)
- Prototyping and maintaining several side projects, for fun and learning.

### Things I’d love to do in the future

- Potentially do another startup
- Work on techno policy for the governement - combining my computer science and political science background.
- Visit China 🇨🇳 my accestral homeland.

### How to communicate with me

- Most optimal way is to provide some jotted down notes in a 1:1 doc before a meet so that I have had some time to prepare thoughts rather than shoot from the hip in a meet.
- In a group setting, same thing - having asynchronous agenda with context, asks, and decision to be made is the most helpful and uses everyones time the best.

### Preferred Communication Method

- Asychronous methods:
  - Chat apps like Slack, Teams, etc.
  - If urgent email or text me.

### Working Hours

Split shift style. I am usually operational at my desk between 8:30 am and 10 pm on weekdays, and 12 - 6 on weekends. On week days, I take a break (usually 1.5 - 2 hours) in between depending on the schedule for the day, usually** doing physical activity like the gym - this physical activity is very important for me especially if I'm doing long hours. As I always say, it's a marathon not a sprint!

### What my average week looks like

- On Monday, set the tone for the week, set priorities and outcomes with the team
- Daily standups as needed (async or sync)
- On Friday's review the week with the team and set the tone and objectives for the following week.

## Personal README

The objective of my readme page is to introduce myself and share some information that maybe helpful for us to break the ice, communicate, collaborate and adjust expectations effectively.

In it, I share my professional and personal values, what drives me, what makes me grumpy, and what my workflow looks like.

It will probably be useful mostly for my colleagues and collaborators (current and future) to read.

### Quick Bio

My career in tech began as the co-founder & CTO of Adauris which I done for about 4.5 years and was later acquired by a US company.

My experience spans cloud architecture, full stack development, applied A.I., and leading teams.

I'm quite active in the dev ecosystem for developers & technical founders in groups such as Microsoft, Google Developer Groups, Google for Startups, Deepmind, Vancouver.dev, the League of Innovators, and other organizations speaking on topics around A.I, Dev Tools, Cloud Infrastructure, and technical entrepreneurship around North America.

After Adauris, I went on to be the Head of Engineering at YGG - Yield Guild Games, the first & largest Web3 crypto Gaming DAO in the world. This experience was a signifcant period of growth for me leadership wise as I learned to managed a team of 20 and other managers. This was also a great experience in diving deep in the world of web3 but realize where my ture passion was (AI & devs).

Today, I'm at Microsoft as a Solution Engineer on the Cloud & AI team focusing on Dev Tools, working on Github Copilot & Agentic DevOps.

Outside of work I love to spend my time doing physical activities especially outdoors. You can catch me climbing a rock face in Squamish BC, or doing a HIIT workout class. I suppose this makes me a typical Vancouverite!

On being a typical Vancouverite, we love the rain (well, most folks don’t), but as part of my personal and professional ethos, I’m a big believer in learning to dance in the rain - metaphorically speaking. I’m an optimist at heart and it’s probably how I’ve gotten through the 0-1 phase startup pain 🙂. I always try to find the opportunity in any challenge and the best in people.

### Random facts

- Favorite video game 🎮 franchieses of all time are Halo, Mass Effect, and Battlefield
- My Myers Briggs personality type is ENFP (The campaigner) which is "a personality type with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Prospecting traits. These people tend to embrace big ideas and actions.

### What are my favorite things to work on

- Coding
- DevRel - I love connecting and learning with other developers
- Making progress/growing in general. This can be professionaly or personally. As long I'm making progress of any kind that's when I'm most content.

### What I value from others

- Growth mindset. Nobody's ever perfect. The important thing to accept it and don't overlook opportunities to improve.
- Integrity. Trust is everything. If the underlying assumption is X person has integrity, it makes everything else easier for both parties.
- Asynchronous work. I have generally work remotely, so I really appreciate it when my team-mates keep a written trace of notes and decisions that may have been taken in my absence.

### What I think are my strengths

- Resourcefulness. I can stretch a budget really far or do a project with minimal resources. Partly why I think I became a founder.
- Accountability. If I say that I'm going to do something, I will deliver. I hate to lie, to disappoint, and I'm not afraid to be transparent
- Resilience. Definitely my superpower. I can take a lot of hits and keeping getting back up.

### Things I'm working to improve

- Leadership. I am always learning to improve this muscle and how to best delegate to others. I've learned how to lean into my servant leadership style to most benefit my team.
- Conflict management. I can feel uncomfortable when conflicts happen. What I've learned is that the only thing you can control in life is yourself and not others. How you respond (not react) is everything.
- Boundary setting. I'm working to be more efficient and intentional with my time. I can take on too much and come at the expense of me or the team. This is an improving area however.

### What makes me uncomfortable

- Overt aggressiveness that's unncessary.
- Being in a siutation that deviates from my values of integrity
- Environments that are noisy and/or crowded.

### What makes me grumpy

- Witnessing injustice and incivilities. When people are not acting in a fair way.
- When people are disrespectful towards me or anyone else.
- Doing work without understanding the why.
- Lack of order and consistency, especially when I have to get my hands dirty. (e.g. contribute to a codebase that I find hard to understand)

### How to know when I'm (really) grumpy

I'm pretty good at masking it to be honest. But I'm generally a calm, collected person so please feel you have the psycholigical safety to ask if doubt about my grumpiness.

### What have my past managers done that I like

- Defend the interests of the team.
- Congratulate successes and efforts, and provide honest feedback to help team-mates improve.
- Take the time to share useful tips and provide coaching when appropriate.
- Not be afraid to roll up their sleeves and help out when times are tough.

### What I do outside of work

- Rockclimbing
- Physical activities like working out, HIIT classes.
- Playing Video games (Battlefield, Halo, Star wars)
- Prototyping and maintaining several side projects, for fun and learning.

### Things I’d love to do in the future

- Potentially do another startup
- Work on techno policy for the governement - combining my computer science and political science background.
- Visit China my accestral homeland.

### How to communicate with me

- Most optimal way is to provide some jotted down notes in a 1:1 doc before a meet so that I have had some time to prepare thoughts rather than shoot from the hip in a meet.
- In a group setting, same thing - having asynchronous agenda with context, asks, and decision to be made is the most helpful and uses everyones time the best.

### Preferred Communication Method

- Asychronous methods:
  - Chat apps like Slack, Teams, etc.
  - If urgent email or text me.

### Working Hours

Split shift style. I am usually operational at my desk between 8:30 am and 10pm everyday. I take a break (usually 1.5 - 2 hours) in between depending on the schedule for the day, usually doing physical activity like the gym.

### What my average week looks like

- On Monday, set the tone for the week, set priorities and outcomes with the team
- Daily standups as needed (async or sync)
- On Friday's review the week with the team and set the tone and objectives for the following week.
